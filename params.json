Please contact us at team-mugatu@googlegroups.com if you are interested in our project.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nWe are a team of five mechanical and electrical engineers, and for our senior design project at Princeton University we are designing and building a robotic hexapod with a passively compliant spine. The goal of the project is to improve stability over rough terrain and obstacles by incorporating a flexible backbone to allow for more natural motion, inspired by the way that mammals and reptiles conform their bodies during locomotion. During this year, we're working to create a segmented hexapod with two decoupled degrees of freedom between each pair of segments. Our hope is to demonstrate experimentally that these passive dynamics lead to to increased performance in locomotion.\r\n\r\n### Origin\r\nOur team was intrigued by the RHex design from UPenn's KodLab and Boston Dynamics and wanted to build upon it. After getting professors involved, we met with one of the original designers of the RHex, and together reached the hypothesis that adding flexibility to the rigid design would improve performance and energy efficiency by enabling more natural gaits. \r\n\r\n### Current Progress\r\nWe are in the process of modeling in CAD, and have completed full 3D simulations of our design's locomotion using Blender, Python, and the Bullet physics engine. We have most of our COTS parts already, and are working concurrently on the hardware and software design. We keep our code, wiki, and issue tracker on a private GitHub repository, and our project is fully funded.\r\n\r\n### Members\r\n```\r\nHayk Martirosyan\r\nGreg Hughes\r\nChris Payne\r\nBrendan O'Leary\r\nThomas Owlett\r\n```","google":"UA-36551469-1"}
