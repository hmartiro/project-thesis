libEPOS is a C library to control the EPOS motor control from maxon motor 
( http://www.maxonmotor.com ) using a GNU/Linux system.



This software is NOT from maxon motor, but was written from scratch
from Marcus Hauser at LSW Heidelberg using the maxon motor
documentation available on their webpage.



It is provided to anyone interested in using an EPOS device under
control of a Linux system WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. Do not blame me if it
destroys your system or eats your cat! It is working fine for me, but
you never know. You have been warned!


Since it is written using only ANSI C, it should run on any *nix
sytem, I guess. But I have not checked and will not do so. If you are
using it on any other system successfully, please let me know.


COMPILING: 
just type 'make'. This will compile the libary as well as an example
program 'filterwheel'.

USING: 
include the header file 'epos.h' into your C code. Link with 
'-l epos'.

See the docu how to use the different functions. You need 'doxygen' to
extract the documentation from the C code. Get it from
http;//www.doxygen.org and just run 'dogygen'

The program 'filterwheel' is included as an example to show you how it
works. We build a filter wheel for one of our telescopes, using a
maxon motor drive and an EPOS as control unit. This program does a
start-up with the EPOS and then uses the 'profile position mode' as
well as the 'homing mode' to turn the filter wheel in the correct
position. 

You should be familiar with the EPOS operation modes, see the EPOS
documentation available at http://www.maxonmotor.com/
